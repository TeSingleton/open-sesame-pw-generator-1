# Open Sesame Password Generator

This project , I was instructed to create a Password Generator. 
The Generator requiremnts are as follows. The character length needed to be between 8-128 characters.
It also required multple character types(numbers/letters/special characters)
I currently am not grasping javasvript as well as I would like. So enlistedt the assitance of the all might google. 
Below in my acknowledgements is the starter code that I sourced to give me an idea of the concepts involved with this project.
